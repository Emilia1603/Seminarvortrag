@article{Logan:2014vp,
	abstract = {These lectures start with a detailed pedagogical introduction to electroweak symmetry breaking in the Standard Model, including gauge boson and fermion mass generation and the resulting predictions for Higgs boson interactions. I then survey Higgs boson decays and production mechanisms at hadron and e+e- colliders. I finish with two case studies of Higgs physics beyond the Standard Model: two-Higgs-doublet models, which I use to illustrate the concept of minimal flavor violation, and models with isospin-triplet scalar(s), which I use to illustrate the concept of custodial symmetry.},
